# Check Outputs Prompts

Ask the model to verify its own outputs.

# Setup

## Python

```{python}

import os
import openai
from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv()) 

openai.api_key = os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY']
```

# Helper function

```{python}


def get_completion_from_messages(messages, model="gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature=0, max_tokens=500):
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=temperature,
        max_tokens=max_tokens,
    )
    return response.choices[0].message["content"]


```

# Detect Harmful Output

## Final response

```{python}

final_response_to_customer = f"""
The SmartX ProPhone has a 6.1-inch display, 128GB storage, \
12MP dual camera, and 5G. The FotoSnap DSLR Camera \
has a 24.2MP sensor, 1080p video, 3-inch LCD, and \
interchangeable lenses. We have a variety of TVs, including \
the CineView 4K TV with a 55-inch display, 4K resolution, \
HDR, and smart TV features. We also have the SoundMax \
Home Theater system with 5.1 channel, 1000W output, wireless \
subwoofer, and Bluetooth. Do you have any specific questions \
about these products or any other products we offer?

## Moderation API

- Check output for potentially harmful content

```{python}

response = openai.Moderation.create(
    input=final_response_to_customer
)
```

. . .

```{python}
moderation_output = response["results"][0]
print(moderation_output)

You are an assistant that evaluates whether \
customer service agent responses sufficiently \
answer customer questions, and also validates that \
all the facts the assistant cites from the product \

3 backticks, i.e. ```.
